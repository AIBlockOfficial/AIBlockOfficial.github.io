Google Ireland (based in Ireland) is our provider of “Google Analytics” and acts as our processor. Google Ireland relies on Google LLC (based in the US) as a processor for its services (both “Google”). Google uses performance cookies (see above) to track the behavior of visitors to our website (duration, frequency of pages viewed, geographic origin of access, etc.) and compiles reports for us on the use of our website on this basis. We have configured the service so that the IP addresses of visitors are shortened by Google in Europe before being forwarded to the US and thus cannot be traced. We have turned off the &quot;Data Forwarding&quot; and &quot;Signals&quot; settings. Although we can assume that the information we share with Google is not personal data for Google, it is possible that Google can draw conclusions about the identity of visitors from this data for its own purposes, create personal profiles and link this data to the Google accounts of these persons. If you consent to the use of Google Analytics, you explicitly agree to such processing, which also includes the transfer of personal data (in particular usage data for the website and app, device information and individual IDs) to the US and other countries not offering adequate data protection from a Swiss/EU perspective. Information on the data protection of Google Analytics can be found here and if you have a Google account, you can find further details on processing by Google here.</p><br><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="32-purposes-of-data-processing-and-legal-basis">3.2 PURPOSES OF DATA PROCESSING AND LEGAL BASIS<a class="hash-link" href="#32-purposes-of-data-processing-and-legal-basis" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>The processing of the data enables us to analyse the surfing behaviour of our users. By evaluating the data obtained, we are able to compile information about the use of the individual components of our website. This helps us to constantly improve our website and its user-friendliness. In these purposes, our legitimate interest lies in the processing of the data. By anonymizing the IP address, the interest of users in the protection of their personal data is sufficiently taken into account.</p><br><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="33-duration-of-the-storage-as-well-as-objection-and-withdrawal-possibility">3.3 DURATION OF THE STORAGE AS WELL AS OBJECTION AND WITHDRAWAL POSSIBILITY<a class="hash-link" href="#33-duration-of-the-storage-as-well-as-objection-and-withdrawal-possibility" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for our recording purposes.
